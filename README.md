# ParKING
This is main branch. Here we push only final versions.

IMPORTANT!!
Before push here, all members of the team should know about it!!!

*For work use dev branch!

Some command you should use:
git branch //to see on which branch you are
git checkout dev //to swith to dev branch
git add . //make git understand which files you would love to commit (. means all changed files from the directory)
git commit -m "Message text" //make a commit (use commits to fix all the changes you've done)
git push -u origin dev //push(upload) files from you local branch to dev remote branch
